    <h1> Humans</h1>
    <p> Human activities contribute to climate change by gauging changes in the earth's atmosphere in the amounts of greenhouse gases , aerosol (which are small particles) and cloudiness.
        The largest known contribution comes from burning fossil fuel , which releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas and aerosols affect climate by altering incoming solar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation that are apart of earthâ€™s energy balance. Which then changes the atmosphere abundance or properties of these gases and particles can lead to the warming and cooling of the climate system.
<br> 
 	Human activities result in emission of four principal greenhouse gases which are carbon dioxide (CO2)  methane (CH4) , nitrous oxide (N20) and the halocarbons. Halocarbons are a group of gases containing fluorine chlorine and bromie.
These gases accumulate in the atmosphere , causing concentrations to increase with time. Significant increase in all these gases have occurred in the industrial era.
