        <h1> Forestry</h1>
    <p> Deforestation and especially the destruction of rainforests are major contributes to climate change. The changing temperatures are driving much changes to the natural and modified forests.
        So what purpose does our forests have?
    - Forests serve many purposes; 70% of Earth's animals and plants live in forests, trees serve a crucial role in the water cycle by returning water vapor back into the atmosphere.
        -Trees keep forest soil moist by blocking the sun, and most importantly trees are awesome for absorbing the greenhouse gases, WHICH also happen to  fuel global warming because of the drastic change in temperature(s). </p>
