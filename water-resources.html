    <h1> Water Resources</h1>
        <p> As earthâ€™s temperature continued to rise we can expect a major impact on our fresh water supplies  on these resources, as temperatures increase as does evaporation which sometimes results in droughts.
 
	Rising temperatures are melting glacial ice at an abnormal rate. Glaciers are an important source of fresh water worldwide some are danger of disappearing with in the 21st century there is a prediction that in a warmer environment that more precipitation will occur as rain more frequent water shortages.
  
     Systems are used to treat and move public supplies do require large amounts of energy produced mainly by burning coal natural gas , oil and other fossil fuels, when we use water we also use energy and contribute to climate change. Bottled  water is also contributor to greenhouse use gas emissions. In order to make plastic bottles and ship them worldwide you need fuel.
